# Customer_segmentation on bank campaign outcome
 
## Project Description 
This project is to create a deep learning model based on "Train.csv" dataset to predict how many people will subscribe to the focus product (Term Deposit) after the bank conducted their marketing campaign. The total data entries of this dataset is 31647.

# How to Install and Run the Project 
If you wish to run this model on your pc, you may download "Train.csv" in dataset folder together with Customer_Segmentation.py and CS_module.py file from the depository section. The generated deep learning models from this dataset has been uploaded for you in 2 separated folders : " pkl_model", "models" in depository section. 

Software required: Spyder, Python(preferably the latest version) 

Additional modules needed: Tensorflow, Sklearn, matplotlib, missingno
